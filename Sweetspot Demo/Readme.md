Prior to the commercial product called Simon there was a technology demo of the smartphone at "Comdex" in Las Vegas on Novermber 1992. The development of it occured between 8/1992 to 11/1992 and was intended to show a vision of the future through a working device. It was designed opaque plastic covers using a rapid SLA process, but management thought it looked like a commercial product already, so a last minute change was made to clear covers. Initially code named "Sweetspot", it was an extremely successful "demo" and generated lots of press. BellSouth also became very interested which helped this development continue and led to a commercial product. It was called a "Personal Communicator" during the technology demo since the term Smartphone was not yet in use.
