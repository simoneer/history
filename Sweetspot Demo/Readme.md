Technology demo for Comdex Novermber 1992. The development occured between 8/1992 to 11/1992 and was intended to show a vision of the future through a working device. Initially code named "Sweetspot", it was an extremely successful "demo" and generated lots of press. BellSouth also became very interested which helped this development continue and led to a commercial product. It was called a "Personal Communicator" during the technology demo since the term Smartphone was not yet known.
