# Simon History
What is a Simon? It was the first Smartphone. This repository contains articles, documentation, and technical data for it. This collection is from the personal files of Frank Canova who was the lead architect for Simon, and from other "Simoneers" who created this groundbreaking device.

The Simon was developed by a small team of dedicated engineers at IBM in the "Advanced Technology" department, managed by Gary Wisgo. It was actually created in two phases:
* Technology demo for Comdex Novermber 1992. The development occured between 8/1992 to 11/1992 and was intended to show a vision of the future through a working device. Initially code named "Sweetspot", it was an extremely successful "demo" and generated lots of press. BellSouth also became very interested which helped this development continue and led to a commercial product. It was called a "Personal Communicator" during the technology demo since the term SmartPhone was not yet known.
* Simon, the first commercial SmartPhone was code named "Angler". It was announced by BellSouth at the end of 1993 and was generally available 1994.
