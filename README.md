# Simon History
What is a Simon? It was the first Smartphone. This repository contains articles, documentation, and technical data for it. This collection is from the personal files of Frank Canova who was the lead architect for Simon, and from other "Simoneers" who created this groundbreaking device.

The Simon was developed by a small team of dedicated engineers at IBM in the "Advanced Technology" department, managed by Gary Wisgo. It was actually created in two phases:
* Technology demo for Comdex Novermber 1992. The development occured between 8/1992 to 11/1992 and was intended to show a vision of the future through a working device. Initially code named "Sweetspot", it was an extremely successful "demo" and generated lots of press. BellSouth also became very interested which helped this development continue and led to a commercial product. It was called a "Personal Communicator" during the technology demo since the term SmartPhone was not yet known.
* Simon, the first commercial Smartphone was code named "Angler". It was announced by BellSouth at the end of 1993 and was generally available 1994.

In many ways, Simon was ahead of its time. Based on AMPS (analog) cellular, it used an internal modem to dial-up remote computers to transfer data. It was also before the internet was well known, so the remote computers were generally running Lotus Notes to act as eMail servers. It had a touch screen at a time when most computers had keyboards and ran on DOS. You could start apps like eMail, calculator, FAX (which was popular then), world clock, address book, calendar, games and more. The technology demo in 1992 also showed examples of weather, stocks, maps and news apps, but these were not in the final product. 

The LCD touch screen was 640x200 pixel CGA size. This made it taller than most phones, and the older cell phone and battery technologies made it thicker. The hardware could also be expanded through a PCMCIA slot. In 1992 it was envisioned that cameras, GPS, and many other types of add-ons would be possible with PCMCIA cards. In the commercial product the slot was only used to add more memory or a pager which could deliver news and text messages.

IBM and BellSouth delivered on its visionary product despite its shortcomings. Simon sold about 50,000 smartphones in an era when there were none. The Apple-I, the first personal computer by comparison sold about 200. IBM however was not a cellular phone company and eventually decided to abandon the follow-on products that were envisioned and leave that development to other companies. There were many attempts and it would be over 13 years before Apple released the first iPhone.
